This repo is for the use of installing the StudyKIK External SignUp Widget. It is currently available for the following projects:

- Vue 3
- Node.js

This will be rolled out for different projects in the future and will be updated accordingly.

Use this repo to learn how to install our widget onto your web page. It is advised to go through the readme and consult with your StudyKIK Project Manager before beginning.

You will be provided ahead of time a Protocol Page UUID to install with this widget. Upon successful installation, participants who sign up through the widget may be prompted to take a digital self-screener and/or will be contacted by StudyKIK's Call Center Agents and, after prescreening, will readily available for their respective research site to view and contact. This is based on the PLP settings from StudyKIK and the agreed recruitment campaign flow by the client.
