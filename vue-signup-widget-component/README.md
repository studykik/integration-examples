# studykik-signup-widget-vue-project

Welcome to StudyKIK’s External Sign-Up widget. The purpose of this widget is to be embedded onto your web page for participants to sign up, take a digital self-screener, and be contacted by StudyKIK’s Call Center for prescreening. This will allow our agents to contact and pre-qualify your participants for your specific research study.

This widget has been built for Vue 3 projects, but will be expanding to other type of projects in the future. 

Please use the template while you develop with Vue 3 in Vite. 


## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
``` 

## Project Configuration

Copy the .env.example to .env and add the following configuration
```sh
# .env.example
VITE_STUDYKIK_SIGNUP_API=
VITE_STUDYKIK_PROTOCOL_LANDING_PAGE_UUID=
```

Your StudyKIK Project Manager will provide the respective credentials for the STUDYKIK_PROTOCOL_LANDING_PAGE_UUID and STUDYKIK_SIGNUP_API. This is critical as it will allow sign ups to be appropriately prescreened for your specific protocol.
