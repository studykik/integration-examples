# studykik-node-js

Welcome to StudyKIK’s External Sign-Up API Example. The purpose of this example is for your system to be able to sign up participants, take a digital self-screener, and be contacted by StudyKIK’s Call Center for prescreening. This will allow our agents to contact and pre-qualify your participants for your specific research study.


## Project Configuration

Your StudyKIK Project Manager will provide the respective credentials for the STUDYKIK_PROTOCOL_LANDING_PAGE_UUID and STUDYKIK_SIGNUP_API. This is critical as it will allow sign ups to be appropriately prescreened for your specific protocol.

Once recieved you will be able to populate `STUDYKIK_SIGNUP_API` and `STUDYKIK_PROTOCOL_LANDING_PAGE_UUID` with in `index.js` 

## Project Setup

```sh
node index.js
